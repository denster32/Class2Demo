      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>
    <p>I joined the Army in my early 20's.  I spent a year in Northen Iraq in a city called Mosul.  I spent 4 years as an infantryman.  When I left the Army I spent a couple of years travelling around the country while continuing my education.  I lived in Seattle, San Diego and Boston.  I studied at several community colleges, changed my degree program several times.  I finished my bachelors degree in electrical engineering at Suffolk University in Boston.  I am excited to finish this Code Fellows program and I'm ready to start a career in software development.
